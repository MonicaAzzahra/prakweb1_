       <p>The international exhibition unit will open on April 18 in Munich, Germany, and other cities will be announced in the coming months. The exhibition's stunning key artwork was also revealed, inviting guests to step into their favorite stories using innovative, immersive technology across ten galleries within the 15,000-square-foot exhibition. The Walt Disney Archives opens its treasure trove, showcasing more than 250 “Crown Jewels,” rarely seen original works of art and artifacts, costumes and props, and other memorabilia. Disney has put together a special behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the company's most popular characters, films, entertainment and attractions—from Disneyland to Walt Disney World and beyond. Ten magnificent and imaginatively themed galleries, all featuring moving stories, unique interactive installations, and fascinating background information, will take visitors on a journey through 100 years of The Walt Disney Company, celebrating classics from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The World of Bizarre , as well as the newest members of the Disney family—Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel, and National Geographic.
